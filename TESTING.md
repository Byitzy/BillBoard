# BillBoard Testing & Issues Tracking

## üéâ **NEW: Smart Bill Approval Workflow**

### ‚úÖ **Intelligent Bill State Management**

- **Status**: IMPLEMENTED - Ready for Testing
- **What was done**: Complete overhaul of bill approval workflow with smart one-time vs recurring bill handling
- **Key Features**:
  - One-time bills go directly to pending approval (no scheduling delay)
  - Recurring bills can auto-approve based on user preference
  - Due date-based processing instead of confusing submission dates
  - Admin dashboard with manual processing capability

### **Test Cases for New Workflow**

2. Leave "Recurring" unchecked
3. Set a due date
4. Submit the bill
5. **Expected**: Bill immediately appears in `/approvals` page as pending approval

#### Test 2: Recurring Bill with Manual Approval

1. Create a new bill with "Recurring" checked
2. Set frequency (e.g., monthly) and start date
3. Leave "Auto-approve when due" unchecked
4. Submit the bill
5. Go to admin dashboard and click "Process Pending Bills"
6. **Expected**: Bills with due dates today/past appear in `/approvals` for manual approval

#### Test 3: Recurring Bill with Auto-Approval

1. Create a new bill with "Recurring" checked
2. Set frequency and start date
3. Check "Auto-approve when due"
4. Submit the bill

### ‚ùå **Member Invitations Not Working**

- **Action Required**: Review bill occurrence generation logic

### ‚ùå **Bill Approvals Page Showing Zeros**
