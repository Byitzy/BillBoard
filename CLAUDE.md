## My Development Preferences
1. **Always use TodoWrite** to track complex tasks and show progress
2. **Check existing patterns** before implementing - look at neighboring files
3. **Follow the existing codebase conventions** exactly
4. **Run type checking** after changes: `pnpm typecheck`
5. **Test builds** before considering tasks complete: `pnpm build`
6. **Prefer editing existing files** over creating new ones unless necessary
7. **Keep implementations consistent** with the project's architecture

## Remaining Development Tasks

### High Priority ðŸ”´
1. **Member Filtering**: Add search/filter functionality to organization member management
   - Filter by name, email, role, join date
   - Search across member details
   - Role-based filtering dropdown

### Medium Priority ðŸŸ¡  
2. **Enhanced Reports**: Expand reporting capabilities
   - Custom date ranges
   - Export scheduling
   - Advanced analytics
   
3. **Notification Enhancements**:

   - Saved search views
   - Bulk import functionality

## Project Status: 95% Complete âœ…

The BillBoard project is feature-complete for MVP with all core functionality implemented:
- âœ… Multi-tenant architecture with proper RLS
- âœ… Complete approval workflow system  
- âœ… File uploads and notifications
- âœ… Audit logging and reporting
- âœ… Production deployment ready

Only minor enhancements remain for full feature parity with specifications.

## Merge Strategy for Upstream
- Only merge upstream changes that are genuine improvements
- Avoid breaking existing approval workflow implementation
- Always test after merging to ensure nothing breaks
- Preserve our custom improvements

## Testing Commands
- `pnpm typecheck` - TypeScript checking
- `pnpm lint` - ESLint checking  
- `pnpm build` - Build verification
- `pnpm test` - Run tests if available

## Git Workflow
- Work on feature branches off `beta`
- Test thoroughly before merging to `beta`
- Only commit when explicitly asked
- Always check git status before major operations
