## My Development Preferences

1. **Always use TodoWrite** to track complex tasks and show progress
2. **Check existing patterns** before implementing - look at neighboring files
3. **Follow the existing codebase conventions** exactly
4. **Run type checking** after changes: `pnpm typecheck`
5. **Test builds** before considering tasks complete: `pnpm build`
6. **Prefer editing existing files** over creating new ones unless necessary
7. **Keep implementations consistent** with the project's architecture

## Pull Request Preferences

- **No emojis** in PR titles or descriptions
- **Author name**: Include "Co-Authored-By: yidy <yidy@pm.me>" in commit messages
- **Keep descriptions clean and professional** without decorative elements
- **Focus on technical details and impact**

2. **âœ… Component Architecture Optimization**:

   - Split massive 1268-line ClientBillsPage component into focused smaller components
   - Created dedicated BillCard, BillsListPage, and ClientCreateBillPage components
   - Improved maintainability and render performance
   - Eliminated expensive client-side operations and batch queries

3. **âœ… Hybrid Server/Client Architecture**:

## Merge Strategy for Upstream

- Only merge upstream changes that are genuine improvements
- Avoid breaking existing approval workflow implementation
- Always test after merging to ensure nothing breaks
- Preserve our custom improvements

## Testing Commands

- `pnpm typecheck` - TypeScript checking
- `pnpm lint` - ESLint checking
- `pnpm build` - Build verification
- `pnpm test` - Run tests if available

## Git Workflow

- Work on feature branches off `beta`
- Test thoroughly before merging to `beta`
- Only commit when explicitly asked
- Always check git status before major operations

Remember: This is MY workspace and preferences. Agents should follow these instructions and remember the context between sessions.
